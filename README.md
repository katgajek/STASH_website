# Project description
The following project is a company website which I created for my friend. In this project I decided to use Bootstrap to practise it as I haven't been much familiar with this library before.
I have just started the project so it hasn't been finished yet.
Technologies I used:HTML5, CSS3, SASS, Bootstrap, jQuery, Gulp.
